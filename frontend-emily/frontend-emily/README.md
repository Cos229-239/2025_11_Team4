# Order Easy – Frontend Practice (Emily Personal Branch)

This branch represents my personal workspace for the **Order Easy** web app project.  
Here, I’m practicing and experimenting with **React, CSS, and Vite** to strengthen my frontend development skills.

While the main team branch already contains a more complete version of the app, my goal is to:
- Understand how the project structure and tools (VS Code, React, GitHub) work.
- Build a basic version of the customer interface (Register / Login screen).
- Prepare for future collaboration on the official frontend.

I’ll continue improving the design and functionality as I gain more experience.
